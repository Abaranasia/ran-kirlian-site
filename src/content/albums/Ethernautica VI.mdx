Sixth volume in the series of recordings based in long format drones and processed raw material. This volume contains three medium size pieces as a result of a series of recording sessions and several evolving process between September and December 2021. These tracks were originally created as a source of inspiration for both myself and meditative purposes.

## Credits

These pieces are based on layers of loops, time stretched motifs and real time recordings, with the addition of lots of effects. They can often sound a bit raw and unpredictable, but it's part of the spirit of these recordings series.

All music composed, performed, mixed and produced by Ran Kirlian
Recorded at The Blue_Room between September and December 2021
