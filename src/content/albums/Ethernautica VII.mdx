Seventh volume in the series of recordings based in long format drones and processed raw material. This volume contains two big size pieces as a result of a series of recording sessions and several evolving process between September and December 2022. These tracks were originally created as a source of inspiration for both myself and meditative purposes. 

These pieces are based on layers of loops, time stretched motifs and real time recordings, with the addition of lots of effects. They can often sound a bit raw and unpredictable, but it's part of the spirit of these recordings series.
