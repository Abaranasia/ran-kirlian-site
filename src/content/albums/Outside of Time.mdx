**Outside of Time** is an immersive sound exploration beyond time and space, where staticity doesn't stop evolving, the limits of reality blur and the mundane vanishes on a dense and warm dream.

With this album, I invite you on a journey into an alternate dimension where nothing is as it seems, allowing the listener to (hopefully) escape from earthly limitations and drift into a state of pure bliss and deep introspection.
