The Infinite Harvest maps the inner journey of an ordinary person who is forced to evolve in a new and convulsive situation in an isolated environment, having to face his fears and discovering his true potential, as reflection of the events of recent months. In his search, reality and dreams are confused in the same way that light and darkness are mixed. For this, the dark atmosphere that almost permanently underlie throughout the album, are delicately combined with melodic and rhythmic elements capable of enhancing the fears, sorrows and joys of our protagonist; therefore, the darkness provided by drones and complex soundworlds are confronted by pianos that bring light and calm with a hint of uncertainty, cellos that are the echo of sorrowful souls and tribal rhythms that portray a journey to the deep.
